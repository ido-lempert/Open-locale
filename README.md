# Open-locale

Open-source localization management platform: a self-hosted alternative to Lokalise.
Nx monorepo with an Angular web app, a NestJS API and PostgreSQL.

> Status: early development. See [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) for the capability map
> and the prioritized phase plan. Not yet licensed - see "License" below.

## Stack

- **Web** - Angular (standalone, zoneless), `apps/web`
- **API** - NestJS + Prisma, `apps/api`
- **DB** - PostgreSQL 16
- **Monorepo** - Nx 24, npm workspaces

## Run with Docker

Prerequisites: Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # adjust secrets
docker compose up --build
```

- Web: http://localhost:4200
- API: http://localhost:3000/api

The Docker configuration is prepared but not yet executed end to end; database-backed
checks in CI run against a real PostgreSQL started by the test harness.

## Develop locally (no Docker)

```bash
npm install
npx nx serve api      # starts API on :3000 (uses embedded Postgres in dev by default)
npx nx serve web      # starts web on :4200, proxies /api to :3000
```

Tests that need a database start a real PostgreSQL automatically
([embedded-postgres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/embedded-postgres)), no Docker required.

```bash
npx nx test api
npx nx build web
```

## Development process

Every development goes through five clean review passes before commit:
developer, product manager, designer, security researcher, QA/integration.
Findings are fixed and the passes re-run; only then is a commit made.
See docs/PLAN.md.

## License

Not yet chosen. MIT is the current recommendation; a LICENSE file lands with that decision.
